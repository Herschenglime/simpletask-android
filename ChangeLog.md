# ChangeLog

### 2.6.8

* [Bugfix] Refresh the task view when updating task(s) through the drawer.


### 2.6.7

* [Feature] Automatically detect the line break used when opening a todo file and make that the default. Your line endings will now stay the same without need to configure anything. If you want to change the used linebreak to windows (\\r\\n) or linux (\\n), you can still do so in the settings.

### 2.6.6

* [Bugfix] Fixed a bug which could lead to duplication of tasks when editing them from Simpletask.

### 2.6.5

* [Feature] Removed the donate button from the free version and created a separate paid version. This also makes Simpletask suitable for [Google Play for Education](http://developer.android.com/distribute/googleplay/edu/index.html).
