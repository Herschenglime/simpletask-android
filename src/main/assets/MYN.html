<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
MYN defines 3 urgency zones, we will map them to lists in Simpletask so that they sort correctly.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Critical Now -&gt; <code>@CriticalNow</code>
</li>
<li>Opportunity Now -&gt; <code>@OpportunityNow</code>
</li>
<li>Over The Horizon -&gt; <code>@OverTheHorizon</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Furthermore MYN defines a Significant Outcome (SOC) zone which needs to be at the top of you list. To achieve that, we map it to:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Significant Outcome -&gt; <code>@!SOC</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
One disadvantage of the <code>todo.txt</code> format in combination with Simpletask is that if the file
doesn't contain any items with a specific list, the list will not show
up in Simpletask. To overcome this, Simpletask has a concept of hidden
tasks. These tasked are marked with `h:1' and by default will not show
up in the task list. However any tags and lists defined on this task
will be available.
</p>

<p>
So in order to make the MYN lists persistent, add a hidden task for
each one of the e.g.:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-txt">@CriticalNow h:1
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Configuring the sort for MYN</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/MYN_sort.png" alt="MYN_sort.png" width="50%" align="center" />
</p>
</div>


<p>
To defer tasks in Simpletask for Defer-To-Do or Defer-To-Review we use the threshold date functionallity. So make sure in settings the <code>Defer by threshold date</code> is checked. You can then use threshold date <code>t:yyyy-mm-dd</code> as startdate in MYN/1MTD
</p>

<p>
You can either hide future tasks (from the <code>Other</code> filter tab) or we can sort them to the end (so they are still visible but out of the way). To achieve that we use the <code>Threshold date in future</code> sort. The other main thing is to sort your list by reversed threshold date so that older tasks will be sorted lower on the list. Besides that it doesn't really matter how you sort after that, see picture the below for an example.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Using the list</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
When you are reviewing the items on your list and you want to defer one or more
tasks, you can select them and use the <code>defer</code> menu item in the overflow menu.
There are some prefilled options which you would use often in MYN/1MTD or you can
defer to a specific date.
After defering the task it will move to the bottom of the listview if it has
been defered into the future and out of your face.
