<h2>Creating the contexts for MYN</h2>
<p>MYN defines 3 urgency zones, we will map them to lists in Simpletask so
that they sort correctly.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Critical Now -&gt; <tt class="docutils literal">&#64;CriticalNow</tt></li>
<li>Opportunity Now -&gt; <tt class="docutils literal">&#64;OpportunityNow</tt></li>
<li>Over The Horizon -&gt; <tt class="docutils literal">&#64;OverTheHorizon</tt></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore MYN defines a Significant Outcome (SOC) zone which needs to
be at the top of you list. To achieve that, we map it to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Significant Outcome -&gt; <tt class="docutils literal">&#64;!SOC</tt></li>
</ul>
<p>One disadvantage of the <tt class="docutils literal">todo.txt</tt> format in combination with
Simpletask is that if the file doesn't contain any items with a specific
list, the list will not show up in Simpletask. To overcome this,
Simpletask has a concept of hidden tasks. These tasked are marked with
`h:1' and by default will not show up in the task list. However any
tags and lists defined on this task will be available.</p>
<p>So in order to make the MYN lists persistent, add a hidden task for each
one of the e.g.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&#64;CriticalNow h:1
</pre>

<h2>Configuring the sort for MYN</h2>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="nil" src="./images/MYN_sort.png" style="width: 80%;" />
</div>
<p>To defer tasks in Simpletask for Defer-To-Do or Defer-To-Review we use
the threshold date functionallity. So make sure in settings the
<tt class="docutils literal">Defer by threshold date</tt> is checked. You can then use threshold date
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">t:yyyy-mm-dd</span></tt> as startdate in MYN/1MTD</p>
<p>You can either hide future tasks (from the <tt class="docutils literal">Other</tt> filter tab) or we
can sort them to the end (so they are still visible but out of the way).
To achieve that we use the <tt class="docutils literal">Threshold date in future</tt> sort. The other
main thing is to sort your list by reversed threshold date so that older
tasks will be sorted lower on the list. Besides that it doesn't really
matter how you sort after that, see picture the below for an example.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-the-list">
<h2>Using the list</h2>
<p>When you are reviewing the items on your list and you want to defer one
or more tasks, you can select them and use the <tt class="docutils literal">defer</tt> menu item in
the overflow menu. There are some prefilled options which you would use
often in MYN/1MTD or you can defer to a specific date. After defering
the task it will move to the bottom of the listview if it has been
defered into the future and out of your face.</p>
