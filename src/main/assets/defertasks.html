        <h1> DeferTasks </h1>
        <p>NOTE: In newer versions you can defer both due date and threshold date and this discussion is moot.</p>
<p>The deferring functionality in Simpletask is the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.michaellinenberger.com/1MTDvsMYN.html">MYN</a> defer to do/review deferring.</p>
<p>It does not intend to be a due date. It is just meant to get low priority tasks out of the way for now and have them reappear at a certain time in the future (1 week, 2 weeks or 1 month). To achieve this I filter task with threshold date in future. When the deferred start date arrives, the tasks will automatically come back into active view (with the right sorts)</p>
<p>You could also use this with a more GTD style tasklist. It's a quick way to get a next action out of the way, without moving it to Someday/Maybe. If you skip reviewing future tasks in your daily or weekly review you will not have to review tasks you'll know you will not do any time soon.</p>
<p>So why not use due:date for this? There are several reasons:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Due dates are generally in the future so it is not very usable for the MYN/1MTD concept of date in future -&gt; out of view.</li>
<li>Defer-able due dates lead to undone and often postponed tasks. A task should only have a due date if it absolutely needs to be done before that day or something bad happens. It should not be a &quot;I wish it to be done on that date&quot; indicator. Both GTD and MYN agree this doesn't work.</li>
</ul>
