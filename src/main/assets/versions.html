        <h1> Versions </h1>
        <p>Simpletask comes in two different versions on the Play Store. Simpletask
and Simpletask Cloudless. Below you can find an overview of the
differences between these versions and which one should be for you.</p>
<p>I intend to maintain both versions. Simpletask because that has the
userbase. Simpletask Cloudless because that's what I use.</p>
<div class="section" id="simpletask">
<h2>Simpletask</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Version with built in support for Dropbox syncing.</li>
<li>Todo files are stored in application storage so cleaned up on
uninstall</li>
<li>Use if you already have a Dropbox account and want a no hassle
install which quickly works.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="simpletask-cloudless">
<h2>Simpletask Cloudless</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>No built in sync support. Depends on other offerings (such as
Dropsync or Foldersync) to sync to a large number of cloud options.</li>
<li>Doesn't require INTERNET permission so is acceptable for stringent
export laws.</li>
<li>Todo files are stored on sdcard (by default in
`data/nl.mpcjanssen.simpletask`) so can also be used in offline
mode.</li>
<li>Will reload the tasklist if an external program changes the todo
file.</li>
<li>Use this if you want to sync to other cloud options than Dropbox or
if you want to use it in offline mode.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="donate-versions">
<h2>Donate versions</h2>
<p>There used to be donate versions in the playstore as well, but because
they are exactly the same as the free version, they were becoming a
hassle to maintain. If you want to donate, you can find a donation link
in the settings.</p>
