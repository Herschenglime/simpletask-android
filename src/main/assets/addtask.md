Adding Tasks
============



Extensions
----------

Simpletask supports the following todo.txt extensions:

-   Due date as due:YYYY-MM-DD
-   Start/threshold date as t:YYYY-MM-DD
-   Recurrence with rec:[0-9]+[dwmy] as described [here](https://github.com/bram85/todo.txt-tools/wiki/Recurrence) but with a twist.
    -   By default Simpletask will use the dates in that task to create the recurring task not the date of completion as descibed in the link. This behaviour can be configured from the settings.
