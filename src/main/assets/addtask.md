This screen allows you to add new tasks or update existing ones. Every line in the text box will become one task. There are two checkboxes:

* Word wrap: Should long lines be wrapped or run off to the right.
* Prefill next: When checked, pressing next (or enter) on the keyboard will prefill the next line with the 
 tags and lists of the previous line. This makes it very easy quickly add multiple tasks with the same lists and tags.

Simpletask supports the following todo.txt extensions:

-   Due date as due:YYYY-MM-DD
-   Start/threshold date as t:YYYY-MM-DD
-   Recurrence with rec:[0-9]+[dwmy] as described [here](https://github.com/bram85/todo.txt-tools/wiki/Recurrence) but with a twist.
    -   By default Simpletask will use the dates in that task to create the recurring task not the date of completion as descibed in the link. This behaviour can be configured from the settings.
