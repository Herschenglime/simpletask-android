Simpletask
==========

:slug: index

Simpletask_ is based on the brilliant `todo.txt <http://todotxt.com>`__
by `Gina Trapani <http://ginatrapani.org/>`__. The goal of the
application is to provide a tool to do GTD without providing an
overwhelming amount of options. Even though Simpletask can be customised
by a fairly large amount of settings, the defaults should be sane and
require no change.

Simpletask_ can be used as a very simple todo list manager or as a more
complex action manager for GTD or `Manage Your Now <{filename}MYN.rst>`__.

Extensions
----------

Simpletask supports the following todo.txt extensions:

- Due date as `due:YYYY-MM-DD`
- Start/threshold date as `t:YYYY-MM-DD`
- Recurrence with `rec:[0-9]+[dwmy]` as described `here <https://github.com/bram85/todo.txt-tools/wiki/Recurrence>`_ but with a twist.

  - By default Simpletask will use the dates in that task to create the recurring task not the date of completion as descibed in the link. This behaviour can be configured from the settings.
