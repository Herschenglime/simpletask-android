Simpletask is based on the brilliant [todo.txt](http://todotxt.com) by [Gina Trapani](http://ginatrapani.org/).
The goal of the application is to provide a tool to do GTD without providing an overwhelming amount of
options. Even though Simpletask can be customised by a fairly large
amount of settings, the defaults should be sane and require no change.

Simpletask can be used as a very simple todo list manager or as a more
complex action manager for GTD or [Manage Your Now](MYN.md).
