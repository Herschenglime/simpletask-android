Simpletask comes in three different versions on the Play Store. Simpletask, Simpletask Cloudless and Simpletask Donate. Below you can find an overview of the differences between these versions and which one should be for you.

I intend to maintain all three versions. Simpletask because that has the userbase. Simpletask Cloudless because that's what I use (Simpletask Donate is the same as Simpletask but costs money).

I intend to combine the cloudless and dropbox only offerings in the future.

## Simpletask

* Version with built in support for Dropbox syncing. 
* Todo files are stored in application storage so cleaned up on uninstall
* Use if you already have a Dropbox account and want a no hassle install which quickly works.

## Simpletask Donate

Exactly the same as Simpletask. Only install this if you want to make a donation.

## Simpletask Cloudless

* No built in sync support. Depends on other offerings (such as Dropsync or Foldersync) to sync to a large number of cloud options.
* Todo files are stored on sdcard (in `data/nl.mpcjanssen.simpletask`) so can also be used in offline mode.
* Will reload the tasklist if an external program changes the todo file.
* Use this if you want to sync to other cloud options than Dropbox or if you want to use it in offline mode.
